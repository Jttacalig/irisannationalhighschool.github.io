# Professional Assessment of INHS Website

> **Note**: This is a proposed website for Irisan National High School, developed by Jhet S. Tacalig, a first-year Architecture student at University of Baguio with a strong ICT background from Baguio National Science High School. Built with React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies, this professional-grade application features a modular architecture that allows for easy adaptation to other educational institutions.
>
> While client-side code is inherently visible in web browsers (as with all websites including Facebook and Google), this project implements industry-standard security measures including code obfuscation, minification, and keeping all sensitive operations on secure servers. The codebase can be readily adapted for other schools while preserving its professional quality, features, and security measures.
